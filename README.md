### Hi!

I'm Ben. I'm a full stack developer by trade, with a particular focus in devops and back end services. In my spare time, I work on generators for tabletop role-playing games and world-building, as well as things in support of that particular niche.

[My personal website](https://benovermyer.com) has a blog, a knowledge base, and a variety of random content. Those interested in procedural generation (without AI) should visit [Iron Arachne](https://ironarachne.com).
