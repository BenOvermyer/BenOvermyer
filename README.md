### Hi!

I'm Ben. I'm a full stack developer by trade. In my spare time, I work on generators for tabletop role-playing games, as well as things in support of that particular niche.

[My personal website](https://benovermyer.com) has a blog you might find entertaining. You might be curious to see what [Iron Arachne](https://ironarachne.com) is. Alternatively, if you use Gemini, you may be interested in my gemlog at gemini://dungeonhack.net.
