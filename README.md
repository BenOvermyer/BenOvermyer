### TÅ¡au!

I'm Ben. I'm ostensibly a DevOps engineer by trade. In my spare time, I work on generators for tabletop role-playing games, as well as things in support of that particular niche.

[My personal website](https://benovermyer.com) has a blog you might find entertaining. You might be curious to see what [Iron Arachne](https://ironarachne.com) is. Or perhaps you're
more interested in [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org), a blog engine that I briefly assisted with and deeply enjoy.
